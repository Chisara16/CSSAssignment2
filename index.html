            <h3>Why I love Technology</h3>
            <p><b><i>Technology</i></b> is very essential and has helped a lot to improve the people's quality of life
            and also improved the economy of different countries. It has provided solutions to most problems
            and economic growth, created job opportunities, given people the opportunity to be creative in 
            their own way and this sparked my love and interest for technology.

            <h3>What I have learnt in this Boothcamp</h3>
            <p>So far in this boothcamp, I have learnt the basics of html and css. I have learnt how a typical 
            website works and how it is being built. I have learnt the different elements and tags used in html,
            the different css properties that we can apply to a project. I earn about using github to save 
            projects and also collaborate effectively with my fellow developers on a project to yield result.
            </p>
            <h3>Importance of CSS</h3>
            <p><b><i>CSS</i></b> is important because it helps us to arrange and beautify our codes to give our website a
            proper appearance to the developer and end users.

            <h3>Difference between Paddings, Margins and Borders</h3>
            <p><b><i>Padding</i></b> is the spacing that occurs between the border box and the content box. It is applied to created
            gap in between a border line and the content. The content here could be a text, image, logo, symbol etc.
            </p>
            <p><b><i>Margin</i></b> is the spacing between the border/content and the main page.</p>
            <p><b><i>Borders</i></b> are enclosed box-like feautures we use to hold,categorize or group contents together.</p>
